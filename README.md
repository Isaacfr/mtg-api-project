<h1>Project Commander Partner</h1>
<span>*This is an ongoing project where I add ideas and functionality as I go. My current focus is the format of Commander and most of the features will be directed towards helping Commander players.*</span>
<p>This is a Fullstack Magic: The Gathering web application project that will help users with building decks and organizing the cards they want/need for decks.</p>

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Tech used: HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, APIs</p>
<p>I have used HTML and JavaScript to make the application functional. I utilize the Scryfall and TCGPlayer APIs for card information such as names, rarity, prices and set names.</p>

<h2>Why Make this Project?</h2>
<p>As a new player to Magic: The Gathering, I was looking into resources into building my first deck. Unfortunately, I could not find an application or website that would tell me what cards/sets I might need to look into for a specific deck. I spent hours using spreadsheets, word documents, and notepads just to build one iteration of a deck. I thought this was time-consuming and messy, having to open several documents and looking up everything on different sites. I want this application to help ease discovery and organization of cards that players are looking for. My goal is to create a hub for players to be able to import/export all the data that they have/need into an application that can reduce the time to find cards and get players back into their next commmander game sooner.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>Async and await functions really help the project because of the amount of information it needs to import from two different APIs. </p>

<h2>Future Optimizations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make the application responsive</li>
  <li>Add Color Symbols from MTG</li>
  <li>Make each element of a table collapsible through the name</li>
  <li>Add CSS</li>
  <li>Debug undefined responses</li>
  <li>Add Back-End Functionality (accounts, lists, authentication)</li>
  <li>Add more features</li>
</ul>
